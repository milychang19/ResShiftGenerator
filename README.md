# Residence Staff Shift Generator
This is a very cool project where you can create a month of shifts for on-call duties 
## Goal
We aim to create solutions that cater to the various challenges in residences, ultimately improving the efficiency of shift scheduling. By incorporating our work, we believe we can significantly reduce the stress and time senior staff invest in this process. Our goal is to enhance the overall schedule, minimizing human errors, and increasing satisfaction among the team.
